# Holding Six FC Bayern

This cluster analysis attempted to establish which players in European football might best fit for the open "holding six" position at FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen.
Throughout the analysis, I will perform different cluster models to see which fits best and provide the most insight.
- DBSCAN Model
- Hierarchical Clustering Model
- Affinity Propagation Model
- Updated Project uses DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, GaussianMixture and MeanShift (Updated: 02.03.2025)

The data for the analysis was gathered from the website FBREF
(https://fbref.com/de/). For the analysis, data from the 2022/2023 season from the seven best leagues in Europa was used.
